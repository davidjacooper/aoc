Day 15 with R
=============

./day15_part1.R < input
./day15_part2.R < input

Note: there are extra parameters in the code that must be changed when using 'simple_input'.

Thoughts: I have used R extensively, but a long time ago. Its vector manipulation capabilities are
amazing -- and lead to some very compact code -- but sometimes require so much careful 
consideration that it might have been easier to just to everything with explicit loops.
