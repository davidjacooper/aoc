Day 4 in Cobol
==============

I used GnuCOBOL (https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io), compiling as follows:

$ cobc -x day4_part1.cbl
$ cobc -x day4_part2.cbl

Thoughts: Cobol is the car designed before anyone properly worked out how wheels work. 

Fun facts:

* You must indent _the entire program_ by 7 spaces.
* To read from standard input ('sysin'), you must declare it as a kind of file (you have to declare input files), and this declaration contains the variable ('input-line' in my case) into which user input will be read.
* String splitting is done by the 'unstring' statement.
