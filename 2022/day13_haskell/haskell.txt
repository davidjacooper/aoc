Day 13 with Haskell
===================

$ ghc Day13_Part1.hs -o day13_part1
$ ./day13_part1 < input

$ ghc Day13_Part2.hs -o day13_part2
$ ./day13_part2 < input

Thoughts: Haskell takes some getting used to, and this particular problem lends itself to all sorts of recursion, but ultimately it makes a lot of sense once you drag yourself over the learning curve.
