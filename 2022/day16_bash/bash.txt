Day 16 with Bash
================

$ ./day16_part1_attempt2_slow_but_correct.bash < input

At the time of writing, I haven't solved part 2, and in fact my solution to part 1 is rather 
inefficient. (It took an hour to run.)

Thoughts: Bash is insideous. With all its text processing constructs, arrays and associative
arrays, it seems as though things should be simpler than they turn out to be. The awkward syntax 
doesn't help, but it can be gotten used to. It's the spelling errors really cripple productivity.
Many times I've spelt a variable name incorrectly, and Bash, of course, doesn't tell you anything.
It also doesn't help that Bash has essentially no type system.
