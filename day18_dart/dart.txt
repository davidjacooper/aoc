Day 18 in Dart
==============

$ dart compile exe day18_part1.dart
$ ./day18_part1.exe < input

OR
$ dart run day18_part1.dart

[And the same for part 2.]


Thoughts: Dart is very Java/C#-like, and quite pleasant, though some things tripped me up; e.g., the integer division operator is "~/". I like the constructor assignment shortcut of putting "this.x" in the parameter list.
